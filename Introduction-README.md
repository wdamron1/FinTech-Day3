# FinTech-Day3
My name is William Damron, I have a degree in economics from Arizona State University and I graduated in 2016. I currently work at a company that does compensation analytics for the hospitality and healthcare industries. It is a nice job, but I am looking for something more engaging.
My career goals include getting a new job in the finance industry, preferably something to do with investments. I am also interested in the stock market and creating algorithms to help me notice patterns more easily.
I chose FinTech as a career path because I have always found coding and finance interesting, so I thought it would be cool to combine the two and make a career out of it. I have done some coding on my own in the past, but nothing official like this class.
